# Plato-s-Pizza

I've had the pleasure of diving into the Maven Pizza Challenge, where I stepped into the role of a BI Consultant for Plato's Pizza, a charming Greek-inspired pizza place in New Jersey. 🍕

My mission: to help the restaurant leverage its transactional data to drive sales and enhance operations. 📊💼

Here's a sneak peek of the insights I uncovered:

🔹 Peak Hours Analysis : Weekdays see the highest number of orders between 12 PM and 1 PM, while weekends peak in the evening from 5 PM to 8 PM. And Off  all the month in Q4, only November (11.79k) peaked average order/month.

🔹 Sales Performance: An average price of $16.17 across all sizes. The most ordered Pizza was classic Deluxe Pizza. Despite this number, it only managed $38.4K in revenue behind Thai Chicken($43.3K), Barbecue Chicken($42.4K) and California Chicken($41.4K).

The Brie Carre Pizza was only ordered 48 times, 180 less than average orders per pizza type(667.14). it averaged $23.65 across all sizes making it the most expensive pizza type; thus, not popular amongst customers.

🔹 Financial Metrics: August didn't record as high revenue when related with the orders. This affected the Q3 revenue. Also, it's interesting to see Novem-ber recorded relatively high revenue.

With these insights, Plato's Pizza can now make data-driven decisions to boost efficiency and customer satisfaction. 🌟
